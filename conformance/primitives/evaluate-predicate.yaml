# =============================================================================
# OATF Conformance: evaluate_predicate Primitive Tests
# Tests SDK evaluate_predicate(predicate, value) per SDK spec §5.4.
#
# A predicate is a map of simple dot-path → condition entries combined with AND.
# Each entry resolves its path via resolve_simple_path (no wildcards or
# array indices), then evaluates the condition against the resolved value.
